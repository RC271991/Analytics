# Algorithms
The following file is a sample of all the common Machine Learning algorithms. It doesn't go in depth of how the formulas are developed; rather than, it displays the math of how I developed the parameters and algorithms that are in the individual code scripts.

One thing to consider, is that the algorithms do not follow the proper procedure of separating data into train & test sets, cross-validation etc. I wanted to focus more on the algorithms, so the reader can implement the Machine Learning algorithms as needed. I will continuously be adding more algorithms to this file. As it is a toolbox where anyone or I can easily access the scripts and apply to data.
